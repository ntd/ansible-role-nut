Ansible Role: NUT
=================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ntd/ansible-role-nut.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ntd/ansible-role-nut)

Installs and configures [NUT](http://networkupstools.org/) (Nework UPS
tools) on Debian based systems.

Role Variables
--------------

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see
`defaults/main.yml`):

    nut_managed_config: true

If this is set to false, none of the following options will have any
effect, that is any and all changes under `/etc/nut/` will be your
responsibility. This is often desirable when you have complex
configurations.

    nut_host: localhost
    nut_user: monitor
    nut_password: Whatever...

Mainly used for configuring the monitor user. A user in the NUT sense is
*not* the typical user a UNIX administrator is used to.

    nut_ups:
      - name: UPS
        driver: riello_ups
        device: /dev/ttyUSB0
        description: Some descriptive information
        extra: |
          maxretry = 10
          retrydelay = 1

`name` is an arbitrary string that must identify univocally the UPS.

`driver` depends on your hardware and must be one of the [available NUT
driver](http://networkupstools.org/stable-hcl.html). Be sure the NUT
version installed on your server has that specific driver available.

`device` is device where the UPS is listening (typically an USB port or
a serial device).

`description` is optional and is an arbitrary string used for debugging
and reporting purposes.

`extra` is an optional multiline text to be inserted verbatim in the
global section of the relevant configuration file.

Other less used variables, all of them optionals:

    nut_mode: standalone # `man 5 nut.conf`     MODE directive
    nut_powervalue: 1    # `man 5 upsmon.conf`  MONITOR directive, powervalue field
    nut_role: master     # `man 5 upsmon.conf`  MONITOR directive, type field
    nut_services:        # Name of the services to enable
      - nut-driver
      - nut-monitor
      - nut-server

Users
-----

The user configured using the built-in variables `nut_user` and `nut_password` is used
both for the server (`upsd.users`) and client (`upsmon.conf`) automatically. If you
want to provision additional users (e.g. to use them with external systems), you can
specify additional users like this:

```yaml
nut_additional_users:
  - name: nutuser1
    password: password1
    role: user
  - name: nutuser2
    password: password2
    role: admin
    extra: |
      sdtype = 2
```
